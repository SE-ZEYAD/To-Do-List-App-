Responsive To-Do List App Documentation
Overview
The To-Do List App is a front-end application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, with data persistence enabled through local storage.

Features
Responsive Design:

The app is designed to work seamlessly on devices of all sizes.
CSS media queries are used to adjust the layout and styling based on the screen size.
Local Storage:

Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage.
This ensures that tasks persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.
Tasks are only removed when the user explicitly deletes them from the app.
Files and Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the app.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for adding, displaying, and deleting tasks.
How to Use

Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.
Viewing Tasks:

All added tasks are displayed in a list below the input field.
Each task is accompanied by a "Delete" button.
Deleting Tasks:

Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list and local storage.
